<p>After login, please click on the &quot;System&quot; at the top-right corner and you 
will see this:</p>

<p><img border="0" src="images/system.png" width="799" height="479"></p>

<p>You can finish all system configurations here. Let&#39;s see the &quot;Configuration&quot; 
first:</p>

<p><img border="0" src="images/configuration.png" width="800" height="957"></p>

<ul>
  <li>Program Name: The program name will be used when sending email and shown on 
  the top header.</li>
  <li>Date Format: Set the date format.</li>
  <li>Automatic Redirection: After you submit a form or perform any setting, if 
  the action is successfully accomplished, we will show a confirmation page. If 
  the Automatic Redirection is set to YES, no confirmation will be shown. We will 
  just redirect the page.</li>
  <li>Authentication method for normal users: There are two authentication 
  methods in Bug Tracker - &quot;Storing user&#39;s password in Bug Tracker database&quot; and 
  &quot;Using IMAP server&quot;. 
  Notice that you will still have to add the users even if you use the IMAP authentication. The 
  user&#39;s information besides the password is still saved in the database.</li>
  <li>Sender&#39;s name when sending system email: This is the sender&#39;s name 
  when sending email.</li>
  <li>Sender&#39;s email: When sending email, we will use this email to be the 
  sender&#39;s email address.</li>
  <li>Send mail function: Bug Tracker can send email in 2 ways: &quot;Using PHP&#39;s 
  mail() function&quot; or &quot;Using Bug Tracker&#39;s SMTP function&quot;. If you are running 
  Bug Tracker on FreeBSD or Linux box which is able to send email by the &quot;mail&quot; 
  command, we could use it to send email (this is default). However, if you are 
  running Bug Tracker on a Windows machine, or the mail server requires 
  authentication to send email, you would have to use the SMTP functions 
  implemented by Bug Tracker.</li>
  <li>Allow users to subscribe projects: Set to &quot;YES&quot; if you allow users to 
  subscribe projects. Subscribed users will receive email notification when 
  report created or updated. However, if you have a lot of users, the email 
  traffic could be huge.</li>
  <li>Max Area/Max Minor Area: You can set the area owner in the project. This 
  the max area allow when add new area.</li>
  <li>Max filter for each user: Every user can has their own filters. The filter 
  will be used to filter the project database. This is the maximum of filters allowed for 
  each user.</li>
  <li>Max shared filters for each user: Users can share their filters to others. 
  We can set limitation on the number of shared filters.</li>
  <li>Max log item in syslog: The system will rotate the syslog when it achieves 
  the max log items.</li>
</ul>

<p><a name="3.2"><tt class="chtitle2">3.2 Groups</tt></a></p>

<p>A User has to belong to one group. The permission system in Bug Tracker is 
based on group. You can grant permission to use features and status. For 
example, you might want to add the group &quot;Marketing&quot; and allow them to manage the 
customer feedback system. Or add group &quot;R&amp;D Manager&quot; to have full permission, 
and group &quot;R&amp;D Staff&quot; can&#39;t delete reports, nor delete projects.</p>

<p>The &quot;Status Allowance&quot; allow you to set the statuses that a group can use. 
You might want to disable some status for particular group. For example, only 
a project manager can set the status of a report to &quot;By design&quot;, only 
member of the quality 
control team can set the status to &quot;Could not reproduce&quot;.</p>

<p><a name="3.3"><tt class="chtitle2">3.3 Users</tt></a></p>

<p>On the users setting page, you can add/edit/delete users. A user&#39;s information 
should at least contain username, email, and password. The username can not be 
changed after added. The username can not contain special characters, such as 
\$,&quot;*&lt;&gt;()\.</p>

<p>I highly recommend you not removing any user account after added. The report 
data has to refer the username. If you remove a user, the user information in 
report table will be set to null. If you would like to disable an user account, 
just edit the user and set the &quot;Account Status&quot; to &quot;Disabled&quot;.</p>

<p>You can grant an user the right to access projects. Users can only see projects 
for which 
&quot;Project Visible&quot; is checked. You can set the project visible on the project 
management page, too. Users who have the permission to edit projects can edit users&#39; 
&quot;Project Visible&quot; in project management page, too.</p>

<p><a name="3.4"><tt class="chtitle2">3.4 Feedback System</tt></a></p>

<p>The Bug Tracker has a customer feedback interface. You can edit the attribute 
of the Feedback System.</p>

<p><img border="0" src="images/feedback_system.png" width="806" height="726"></p>

<ul>
  <li>System Name: The system name will be shown on the top of feedback system 
  and the email notification. You might want to add your company name to the 
  system name.</li>
  <li>Sender&#39;s name when sending system email: When a customer reports feedback or 
  an 
  internal user updates the feedback, the system will send a notification to the 
  customer and specified internal users. The Sender&#39;s name will be used when 
  sending email.</li>
  <li>Sender&#39;s email: This is the email address to be used when sending the 
  above email.</li>
  <li>Feedback System Login Mode: There are three login modes in the feedback 
  system - Customer Mode, Anonymous Mode, and Mixed Mode. We only allow existing customer 
  users to login under Customer Mode. Users can register their own account under 
  Anonymous Mode and the newly registered user will be assigned to Anonymous group. Under 
  Mixed Mode, both customer user and anonymous users can login to the system.&nbsp; 
  If the Login Mode has been set to &quot;Disabled&quot;, none can access the customer 
  feedback system.</li>
  <li>Default reply when import report: After a customer reported a bug, internal users, 
  who have the permission to manage the feedback system, can update the report. If 
  the report is verified and imported into the internal database, we will change the 
  status to &quot;In Process&quot; and send a notification to customer. This is the content 
   
  of the notification message.</li>
  <li>Message to append to report when imported internal report closed: After 
  customer feedback has been imported into the internal database, if the related 
  internal report has been closed, we will update the external feedback system 
  and write this message to the feedback system. We will replace the key word 
  &quot;__STATUS__&quot; with the status name of the related internal report.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Feedback System can be completely separated from Bug Tracker. You can move 
the feedback_site directory to another server or directory if you want. Please 
refer to chapter 4.3 for more information.</p>

<p><a name="3.5"><tt class="chtitle2">3.5 Customer management</tt></a></p>

<p>If the feedback system login mode is &quot;Customer Mode&quot;, only customer users 
that are added in Customer management can login. You have to add a Customer 
Group before adding Customer Users. After adding a customer group, you can start 
to add &quot;customer users&quot; that belongs to the customer group. The 
&quot;Anonymous&quot; customer group is a default system group and can not be removed. It is 
the default 
group of anonymous customer users.</p>

<p>You can set the &quot;Project Visible&quot; to grant customer group permission on projects 
that they can access. In the &quot;add/edit&quot; customer user page, you can edit the 
attributes of customer users. Just like a system user, removing a customer group or 
a customer user is not recommended. Set the &quot;Account Status&quot; to &quot;Disabled&quot; if you would 
like to disable an account.</p>

<p>If a customer user&#39;s &quot;Receive notification when associate reports&quot; is set to 
&quot;YES&quot;, the user will receive a notification when users of the same customer 
report/update feedback.</p>

<p><a name="3.6"><tt class="chtitle2">3.6 Status Management</tt></a></p>

<p>I don&#39;t recommend you to change a status name after using Bug Tracker for a 
while. However, if you would like to change status name or add more statuses, you 
can use &quot;status management&quot; to edit a status.</p>

<p>We save the status id in report items. If you edit a status name, the reports 
that have the same status id will be changed, too. So if you would like to change the 
status &quot;Duplicated&quot; into &quot;Repeated&quot;. That&#39;s fine. You can just edit it since 
they have the same meaning. However, if you want to delete &quot;Duplicated&quot; and add 
a new status &quot;Pending for decision&quot;, DO NOT use edit. Please delete the 
&quot;Duplicated&quot; and add a new status &quot;Pending for decision&quot;.</p>
